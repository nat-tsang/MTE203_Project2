# MTE203 Final Project
For this project, I made an image classifier from scratch for the MNIST dataset using a multilayer perceptron. To minimize error associated with my network's predictions during the training process, I used backpropagation and gradient descent as an optimization algorithm. This project achieved a 98% percent.
